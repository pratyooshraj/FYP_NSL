Step 1: Image acquisition
1.0 run video_to_image: this converts all videos with single letters to folder of images--done
1.1 run combo_video to image: this captures each letter from a single video and stores it in their respective directory as per user key input
1.2 capture_image: capture images and store in directory of vowel name

2   move files to respective locations using copy_file.py

Step 3: Preprocessing
3.1 augment
3.2 train_test_val_split
3.3 annotate_hands_eff: needs to be done in batches, memory and cpu intensive

Step 4: Create YOLO data
4.1 run move_yolo_files: to move images/annotations from sub-directory of letter to train/test/val folder


4. create yolo_data         don't think this runs properly
